        <h2>What's so bad about this recipie?</h2>
             <p>to start, it's not even really a recipie. i will say that <em>i</em> find it delicious, but the very fact that you're combining pasta and sriracha is basically a cultural crime on a global level. if you insist on trying it for yourself, the instructions are below</p>
        
        <h3>i solemnly swear i am up to no good</h3> 
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>spaghetti. it doesn't matter how much because history will forget this<li>
                <li>sriracha</li>
                <li>olive oil</li>
                <li>salt</li>
                <li>nooch (nutritional yeast)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>What do I do?</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>first make the spaghetti you animal</li>
                <li>after you've performed the only civilized step in this recipie, put this italian cultural icon into a bowl, and then butcher this ancestral meal by adding enough olive oil that you get uncomfortable, then salt, sriracha (go easy on it), and nutritional yeast to soak up the excess olive oil.</li>
                <li>eat, enjoy, and never speak of this to anyone.</li>
            </ol>
